# LIA

The Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) for this course involves
developing a small project of your choice using Django, either solo
or in pair. While the subject is up to you, the project must meet
the requirements listed below.

I must confirm your project before you start working on it.

## Requirements

-   At least one model should contain a relationship field.
-   At least one model should be registered in the admin. Modifications
    made through the admin should be reflected on the website in one
    form or another.
-   It must be possible to modify records from the website. The model to
    which those records belong to can be the same as the one registered
    in the admin.
-   The website must have a search functionality.
-   The website must contain links for all its pages (i.e., I should not
    have to guess their URLs).
-   Response should return proper HTML, but styling is not required.

## Submission

The assignment must be submitted through [GitHub Classroom][] March 1st at
the latest.
