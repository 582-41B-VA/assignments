# Homework: Task management application API

The first project you will build in this course is a simple task
management application (think Google Keep, Todoist and the like),
written in Python.

To familiarize yourself with this new language, you will begin by
building the application's programming interface (API).

## Requirements

-   The API must contain functions to **create**, **read** and
    **delete** tasks.
-   Tasks should have a unique ID, a name, and an optional due date.
-   Data should be stored in-memory. There is no need to connect
    the application to a database.
-   The interface should follow the object-oriented paradigm. Data and
    functionality should be bundled together in a class.

## Tips

-   You should not need to define more than one or two classes.
-   Try sketching out the program's structure in pseudo-code before
    starting to code in Python.
-   Remember that methods act on data. What is the data here? How will
    it be manipulated?

## Extra

-   The API must contain a function for **modifying** tasks, and it
    should be possible to mark tasks as "done" without deleting them.
-   Add a command-line interface to your application.
